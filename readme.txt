This is kind of a horror game where player have to look around to find things that help and escape.
There is four light, one spot light pointing at the key on chair,
one spot light as the main lamp on top, one point light as the lamp on table
and one more spot light as player's torch.

The objective of the game is to open the door that is locked.

At the start player can choose to find the switch to turn on the ceiling light and change to white or green
base on personal preference. If player look around, there is a point light pointing towards the chair
which has key on it. After player picked up the key then he/she will be able to unlock the door and open it.
End. Enjoy!
